# Automation Infrastructure Plan

## Infrastructure Overview

### Automation Architecture

This document outlines the automation infrastructure required to support the enhanced memory bank system with constitutional compliance, phase-gate validation, and TypeScript ecosystem integration.

### Core Automation Components

#### 1. Constitutional Compliance Engine

```typescript
interface ConstitutionalComplianceEngine {
  // Core compliance validation
  validateCompliance(scope: ValidationScope): ComplianceResult;
  auditArchitecture(target: ArchitecturalTarget): AuditResult;
  detectDrift(baseline: ArchitecturalBaseline): DriftAnalysis;

  // Automated enforcement
  enforceCompliance(violations: ComplianceViolation[]): EnforcementResult;
  preventViolations(context: DevelopmentContext): PreventionResult;
  escalateViolations(criticalViolations: CriticalViolation[]): EscalationResult;

  // Reporting and analytics
  generateComplianceReport(period: TimePeriod): ComplianceReport;
  analyzeComplianceTrends(data: ComplianceData[]): TrendAnalysis;
  recommendImprovements(analysis: ComplianceAnalysis): ImprovementPlan;
}
```

#### 2. Phase-Gate Automation System

```typescript
interface PhaseGateAutomationSystem {
  // Gate management
  configureGates(workflow: WorkflowDefinition): GateConfiguration;
  executeGateValidation(
    phase: string,
    criteria: GateCriteria[]
  ): ValidationResult;
  enforceGateRequirements(
    gate: PhaseGate,
    context: ExecutionContext
  ): EnforcementResult;

  // Workflow automation
  advancePhase(currentPhase: string, nextPhase: string): PhaseTransition;
  blockProgress(gateFailures: GateFailure[]): ProgressBlock;
  resumeProgress(resolvedIssues: ResolvedIssue[]): ProgressResumption;

  // Quality assurance
  validateQualityGates(quality: QualityMetrics): QualityValidation;
  enforceQualityStandards(standards: QualityStandards): StandardsEnforcement;
  generateQualityReport(metrics: QualityMetrics[]): QualityReport;
}
```

#### 3. Workflow Orchestration Engine

```typescript
interface WorkflowOrchestrationEngine {
  // Workflow definition and execution
  defineWorkflow(specification: WorkflowSpecification): WorkflowDefinition;
  executeWorkflow(
    workflow: WorkflowDefinition,
    context: ExecutionContext
  ): WorkflowExecution;
  monitorWorkflow(execution: WorkflowExecution): WorkflowStatus;

  // Task automation
  automateTaskCreation(requirements: TaskRequirements): TaskCreation;
  orchestrateTaskExecution(tasks: Task[]): TaskOrchestration;
  trackTaskProgress(tasks: Task[]): ProgressTracking;
