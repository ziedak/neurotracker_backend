## 🎯 Purpose

The Memory Bank system provides task-focused development workflow management for this enterprise-grade TypeScript microservices architecture. It enables:

- **Organized Task Management**: Structured approach to feature development and maintenance
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time visibility into task completion and blockers
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Comprehensive documentation of architectural decisions and patterns
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains understanding of complex system interactions

## 🏗️ Workspace Overview

### Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Elysia v1.3.8 with Node.js adapter
- **Language**: TypeScript with strict type checking
- **Package Manager**: pnpm workspace configuration
- **Real-time**: Native WebSocket support with connection management
- **Databases**: Redis, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse clients
- **Authentication**: JWT with role-based access control
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging, metrics, and health checks

### Microservices Architecture

## 📊 Architecture Highlights

### Key Interfaces Documented

- **ServerConfig**: Comprehensive Elysia server configuration
- **WebSocketHandler**: Real-time communication management
- **JWTPayload**: Authentication and authorization system
- **HealthCheck**: Service monitoring and observability
- **Metric**: Performance and operational metrics
- **CircuitBreaker**: Resilience patterns

### Implementation Patterns

- **Shared Library**: `@libs/elysia-server` provides consistent server creation
- **Singleton Clients**: Database clients with connection pooling
- **Fluent API**: ElysiaServerBuilder for complex server configuration
- **Event-Driven**: WebSocket rooms and user session management
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript coverage

## 🔧 Usage Guidelines

### Creating New Tasks

Follow the createTask.prompt.md instructions:

```bash
# Task naming convention: YYYY-MM-DD-task-name
mkdir .memory-bank/tasks/2025-08-09-new-feature-development

# Copy and customize templates
cp .memory-bank/templates/task-template.md .memory-bank/tasks/2025-08-09-new-feature-development/action-plan.md
cp .memory-bank/templates/progress-template.json .memory-bank/tasks/2025-08-09-new-feature-development/progress.json
```

### Task Types

- `feature-[name]` - New feature development
- `refactor-[component]` - Code refactoring
- `bug-[issue]` - Bug investigation/fix
- `optimize-[system]` - Performance optimization
- `cleanup-[area]` - Code cleanup/maintenance
- `research-[topic]` - Investigation/research
- `setup-[tool]` - Infrastructure/tooling

### Conservative Project Approach

**Enterprise-Grade Considerations:**

- 50+ TypeScript files with sophisticated architecture
- WebSocket integration with both native Elysia and messaging library
- Multiple database clients with health monitoring
- Comprehensive telemetry and error handling
- Risk Level: LOW-MEDIUM when enhancing existing infrastructure

**Best Practices:**

- Start with existing patterns and enhance incrementally
- Avoid creating new complexity layers unnecessarily
- Leverage comprehensive telemetry for insights
- Test incrementally with existing infrastructure
- Document architectural decisions and trade-offs

## 📈 Current Status

### Completed Analysis

✅ **Workspace Interfaces Scan** (2025-08-09)

- Documented 15+ core interfaces
- Analyzed 20+ implementation classes
- Mapped 4 microservices with their capabilities
- Created comprehensive architectural overview
- Established memory bank system foundation

### Architecture Documentation
