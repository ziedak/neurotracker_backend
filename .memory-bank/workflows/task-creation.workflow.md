# Task Creation Workflow

## Constitutional Integration

### Workflow Overview

This workflow integrates constitutional checks and phase-gate validation into the task creation process, ensuring all development activities comply with the Nine Articles of TypeScript Microservices Architecture.

### Phase-Gate Integration

#### Phase 0: Pre-Creation Validation

```yaml
gates:
  - constitutional_compliance_check
  - architectural_alignment_review
  - infrastructure_requirements_assessment

validation_criteria:
  - [ ] Task aligns with Article I (Dependency Injection)
  - [ ] Task supports Article II (Service Registry)
  - [ ] Task considers Article III (Configuration Management)
  - [ ] Task addresses Article IV (Error Handling)
  - [ ] Task includes Article V (Telemetry)
  - [ ] Task plans for Article VI (Database Layer)
  - [ ] Task considers Article VII (Caching Strategy)
  - [ ] Task supports Article VIII (Authentication)
  - [ ] Task aligns with Article IX (Monitoring)
```

#### Phase 1: Task Specification

```yaml
template: feature-specification.md
required_sections:
  - business_context
  - technical_requirements
  - architectural_constraints
  - uncertainty_markers
  - constitutional_compliance

validation_gates:
  - specification_completeness
  - architectural_compliance
  - uncertainty_identification
```

#### Phase 2: Implementation Planning

```yaml
template: implementation-plan.md
required_sections:
  - technical_approach
  - architectural_integration
  - testing_strategy
  - deployment_plan
  - constitutional_verification

validation_gates:
  - technical_feasibility
  - architectural_soundness
  - constitutional_alignment
```

#### Phase 3: Task Breakdown

```yaml
template: task-breakdown.md
required_sections:
  - actionable_tasks
  - dependency_mapping
  - timeline_estimation
  - quality_gates
  - constitutional_checkpoints

validation_gates:
  - task_clarity
  - dependency_completeness
  - constitutional_coverage
```

#### Phase 4: Architecture Review

```yaml
template: architecture-review.md
required_sections:
  - architectural_analysis
  - compliance_verification
  - integration_assessment
  - risk_evaluation
  - constitutional_validation

validation_gates:
  - architectural_integrity
  - constitutional_compliance
  - integration_readiness
```

#### Phase 5: Progress Validation

```yaml
template: progress-validation.md
required_sections:
  - quality_gates
  - progress_tracking
  - constitutional_monitoring
  - validation_criteria
  - completion_requirements

validation_gates:
  - quality_assurance
  - constitutional_adherence
  - completion_criteria
```

### Constitutional Compliance Automation

#### Automated Checks

```typescript
interface ConstitutionalCheck {
  article: string;
  requirement: string;
  validation: () => boolean;
  severity: "error" | "warning" | "info";
}

const constitutionalChecks: ConstitutionalCheck[] = [
  {
    article: "Article I",
    requirement: "Dependency Injection Implementation",
    validation: () => checkDependencyInjection(),
    severity: "error",
  },
  {
    article: "Article II",
    requirement: "Service Registry Integration",
    validation: () => checkServiceRegistry(),
    severity: "error",
  },
  // ... additional constitutional checks
];
```

#### Workflow Automation Points

1. **Task Creation**: Constitutional pre-check before task initialization
2. **Template Population**: Automatic constitutional section generation
3. **Progress Tracking**: Constitutional compliance monitoring
4. **Quality Gates**: Constitutional validation at each phase
5. **Completion Verification**: Final constitutional compliance audit

### Integration Points

#### With Memory Bank System

- Constitutional checks integrated into task templates
- Phase-gate validation enforced at each milestone
- Automatic constitutional compliance tracking
- Quality gate enforcement through workflow automation

#### With Development Process

- Pre-commit constitutional validation hooks
- Continuous constitutional compliance monitoring
- Automatic architectural drift detection
- Quality gate integration with CI/CD pipeline

### Uncertainty Handling

#### Uncertainty Markers Integration

- **[UNCERTAIN]**: Constitutional interpretation unclear
- **[ASSUMPTION]**: Constitutional compliance assumed
- **[NEEDS_REVIEW]**: Constitutional expert review required
- **[RISK]**: Constitutional violation risk identified

#### Escalation Procedures

1. Constitutional uncertainty identified
2. Automatic escalation to architectural review
3. Expert consultation and resolution
4. Constitutional clarification documentation
5. Workflow update and process improvement

### Quality Assurance

#### Constitutional Validation Checklist

- [ ] All Nine Articles addressed in task planning
- [ ] Constitutional compliance verified at each phase gate
- [ ] Uncertainty markers properly identified and resolved
- [ ] Architectural integration validated
- [ ] Quality gates successfully passed
- [ ] Constitutional expert review completed (if required)

#### Success Metrics

- Constitutional compliance rate: >95%
- Phase-gate pass rate: >90%
- Uncertainty resolution time: <24h
- Quality gate failures: <5%
- Architectural drift incidents: 0

This workflow ensures systematic constitutional compliance while maintaining development velocity and architectural integrity.
