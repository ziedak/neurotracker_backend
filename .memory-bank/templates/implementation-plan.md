## Phase 0: Research & Discovery

### Technical Research Requirements

- [ ] **Infrastructure capability analysis**: [Deep dive into existing systems]
- [ ] **Performance benchmarking**: [Existing system performance characteristics]
- [ ] **Integration pattern research**: [How similar features implemented]
- [ ] **Dependency analysis**: [Library and service dependencies]
- [ ] **Risk assessment**: [Technical and architectural risks]

**Output**: `research.md` with infrastructure verification evidence

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

### Data Model Design

- [ ] **Relationship mapping**: [Data relationships and constraints]
- [ ] **Validation rules**: [Data validation requirements]
- [ ] **Schema evolution**: [Migration and versioning strategy]

### API Contract Design

- [ ] **Service interfaces**: [API endpoint definitions]
- [ ] **Request/Response models**: [Data transfer objects]
- [ ] **Error handling**: [Error response patterns]

**Output**: `data-model.md`, `/contracts/*`, `quickstart.md`, constitutional compliance validation

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the task breakdown will include - NOT executed during implementation planning_

### Task Generation Strategy

- Load implementation plan and design documents
- Generate tasks from constitutional requirements
- Each contract ‚Üí contract test task [Parallel]
- Each data model ‚Üí model creation task [Parallel]
- Each service integration ‚Üí integration test task
- Implementation tasks to satisfy constitutional compliance

### Task Ordering Strategy

- Constitutional compliance verification first
- Infrastructure integration before new development
- Test-driven development: Tests before implementation
- Service registration before service implementation
- Dependency resolution order: shared ‚Üí specific

**Estimated Output**: 20-25 numbered, ordered tasks with constitutional compliance checkpoints

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitutional Compliance has violations that must be justified_

| Constitutional Violation          | Why Needed             | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because       |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., New infrastructure]        | [Specific requirement] | [Why existing systems insufficient]        |
