# Feature Specification Template

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Created**: 2025-09-09  
**Compliance**: Specification-Driven Development (GitHub Spec Kit Integration)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ **Focus on WHAT users need and WHY** - Business value and user requirements only
- ‚ùå **Avoid HOW to implement** - No tech stack, APIs, code structure, or implementation details
- üë• **Written for business stakeholders** - Should be understandable by non-technical stakeholders
- üîç **Mark all ambiguities** - Use `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]` for unclear requirements

## Template Usage Instructions

### When Creating This Specification:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use `[NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]` wherever requirements are unclear
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something important, mark it for clarification
3. **Business focus only**: Avoid technical implementation details
4. **User-centric language**: Write from the user's perspective

### Constitutional Compliance Required:

- All specifications must pass constitutional compliance checks
- Infrastructure verification required before implementation planning
- Security implications must be assessed
- Performance requirements must be defined
