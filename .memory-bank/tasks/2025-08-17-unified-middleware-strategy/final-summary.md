## 🚀 Ready for Production Use

### Immediate Adoption Ready
- **Event Pipeline**: Successfully migrated and tested
- **AI Engine**: Ready for migration using `servicePresets.aiEngine()`
- **Data Intelligence**: Ready for migration using `servicePresets.dataIntelligence()`
- **API Gateway**: Ready for migration using `servicePresets.apiGateway()`

### Migration Path
1. **Install shared library**: Add `@libs/middleware` dependency
2. **Apply service preset**: Use appropriate `servicePresets.{service}()`
