# Task: Unified Middleware Strategy

Date: 2025-08-17
Status: Active

## Objective

Design and implement a unified, reusable middleware architecture for all backend services, centralizing validation, rate limiting, audit, authentication, logging, and error handling.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All services use shared middleware from a central library
- [ ] Middleware interfaces and contracts are standardized
- [ ] Logging and error handling are consistent across services
- [ ] Documentation and usage examples are provided

## Phases

### Phase 1: Inventory & Analysis

**Objective**: Catalog existing middleware logic and patterns
**Timeline**: 1 day
**Dependencies**: Access to all service codebases

### Phase 2: Design Shared Middleware Library

**Objective**: Architect reusable, configurable middleware modules
**Timeline**: 2 days
**Dependencies**: Consensus on interfaces and patterns

### Phase 3: Refactor Services

**Objective**: Migrate services to use shared middleware
**Timeline**: 3 days
**Dependencies**: Regression testing, CI/CD

### Phase 4: Documentation & Validation

**Objective**: Document usage, validate integration, and test
**Timeline**: 1 day
**Dependencies**: Team review

## Risk Assessment

- **Risk**: Service-specific requirements may complicate standardization | **Mitigation**: Allow config overrides and extensibility
- **Risk**: Migration may introduce regressions | **Mitigation**: Incremental rollout and thorough testing

## Resources

- Existing middleware code in all apps
- Elysia framework docs
- TypeScript best practices
- Team feedback
