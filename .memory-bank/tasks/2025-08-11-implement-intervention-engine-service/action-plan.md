# Task: Implement Intervention Engine Service

Date: 2025-08-11
Status: Active
Priority: High

## Objective

Implement a comprehensive intervention-engine microservice that provides real-time delivery of cart recovery interventions through WebSocket connections, multi-channel notifications, and sophisticated tracking capabilities.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Real-time WebSocket intervention delivery system
- [ ] Multi-channel notification system (email, SMS, push)
- [ ] Intervention tracking and analytics
- [ ] Template management and personalization
- [ ] Campaign management with A/B testing
- [ ] Queue system for intervention processing
- [ ] Integration with existing service architecture
- [ ] Full TypeScript type safety
- [ ] Production-ready with comprehensive monitoring

## Phases

### Phase 1: Infrastructure & Core Setup (2-3 hours)

**Objective**: Set up service foundation using existing patterns
**Timeline**: 2-3 hours
**Dependencies**: @libs/elysia-server, existing service patterns

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Create apps/intervention-engine directory structure
- [ ] Set up package.json with workspace dependencies
- [ ] Configure TypeScript and build scripts
- [ ] Create service container using @libs/elysia-server with WebSocket enabled
- [ ] Set up basic health endpoints and monitoring integration
- [ ] Verify WebSocket connection handling works

### Phase 2: Core Delivery System (3-4 hours)

**Objective**: Implement real-time intervention delivery
**Timeline**: 3-4 hours  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1, WebSocket infrastructure

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Implement WebSocket gateway for real-time delivery
- [ ] Create intervention delivery service and controller
- [ ] Set up channel management (WebSocket, email, SMS, push)
- [ ] Implement delivery optimization logic
- [ ] Create intervention queue processing system
- [ ] Add retry mechanism for failed deliveries

### Phase 3: Notification Channels (2-3 hours)

**Objective**: Multi-channel notification support
**Timeline**: 2-3 hours
**Dependencies**: Phase 2, external provider integrations

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Implement email service with template support
- [ ] Add SMS service integration
- [ ] Create push notification service
- [ ] Implement template management system
- [ ] Add personalization engine
- [ ] Configure channel selection logic

### Phase 4: Tracking & Analytics (2-3 hours)

**Objective**: Comprehensive intervention tracking
**Timeline**: 2-3 hours
**Dependencies**: Phase 2, @libs/monitoring

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Create tracking controller and service
- [ ] Implement event tracking logic
- [ ] Add attribution modeling
- [ ] Build performance analytics
- [ ] Create conversion tracking
- [ ] Set up monitoring dashboards

### Phase 5: Campaign Management (2-3 hours)

**Objective**: Template and campaign management
**Timeline**: 2-3 hours
**Dependencies**: Phase 3, template system

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Implement campaign controller
- [ ] Create template management service
- [ ] Add campaign scheduling
- [ ] Implement A/B testing framework
- [ ] Create user segmentation logic
- [ ] Add content optimization

### Phase 6: Integration & Testing (1-2 hours)

**Objective**: Service integration and validation
**Timeline**: 1-2 hours
**Dependencies**: All previous phases

**Tasks**:

- [ ] Test WebSocket connections and message flow
- [ ] Validate multi-channel delivery
- [ ] Test intervention decision logic
- [ ] Verify tracking and analytics
- [ ] Load test WebSocket performance
- [ ] Integration test with other services

## Risk Assessment

- **Risk**: WebSocket connection management complexity | **Mitigation**: Use proven @libs/elysia-server WebSocket patterns
- **Risk**: Multi-channel delivery reliability | **Mitigation**: Implement robust retry mechanisms and fallbacks
- **Risk**: Real-time performance under load | **Mitigation**: Use existing monitoring and implement proper queuing
- **Risk**: Integration complexity with existing services | **Mitigation**: Follow established service patterns and DI container usage

## Resources

- Service Architecture Review: `/home/zied/workspace/backend/.docs/Service_Architecture_Review.md`
- Existing WebSocket patterns in @libs/elysia-server
- Event-pipeline WebSocket implementation for reference
- Existing service structures in apps/ directory
- Workspace shared libraries for consistency

## Technical Architecture

### Core Modules:

```
intervention-engine/
├── src/
│   ├── delivery/          # Real-time WebSocket delivery
│   ├── notifications/     # Multi-channel notifications
│   ├── tracking/          # Event tracking and analytics
│   ├── personalization/   # Content personalization
│   ├── campaigns/         # Campaign management
│   └── queue/             # Processing queues
```

### Key Dependencies:

- @libs/elysia-server (WebSocket support)
- @libs/database (Redis, PostgreSQL)
- @libs/monitoring (metrics, logging)
- @libs/messaging (Kafka integration)
- @libs/utils (utilities)

### WebSocket Features:

- Real-time intervention delivery
- Connection pooling per store
- Room-based messaging
- User session tracking
- Graceful connection management

## Implementation Notes

- **CRITICAL**: Do NOT create Elysia server from scratch - use @libs/elysia-server
- **CRITICAL**: Leverage existing WebSocket capabilities in the library
- **VERIFY**: Check existing service patterns before implementation
- **PATTERN**: Use ServiceContainer for dependency injection like other services
- **CONSISTENCY**: Follow workspace TypeScript configuration and build patterns
