# Task: Implement Event Pipeline Logic

Date: 2025-08-10
Status: Active

## Objective

Implement robust business logic for the event-pipeline service, leveraging shared libraries for messaging, database, monitoring, and schema management.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Event ingestion (WebSocket, REST, batch) is fully functional
- [ ] Events are validated, deduplicated, enriched, and routed
- [ ] Schema registry and validation are integrated
- [ ] Dead letter and retry logic are operational
- [ ] Monitoring and metrics are exposed

## Phases

### Phase 1: Ingestion & Validation

**Objective**: Implement event ingestion endpoints and validation logic
**Timeline**: 1 day
**Dependencies**: messaging, utils, models

### Phase 2: Processing & Routing

**Objective**: Stream, enrich, deduplicate, and route events
**Timeline**: 2 days
**Dependencies**: messaging, database, utils

### Phase 3: Schema & Dead Letter

**Objective**: Integrate schema registry, validation, migration, dead letter, and retry
**Timeline**: 1 day
**Dependencies**: models, database, utils

### Phase 4: Monitoring & Metrics

**Objective**: Expose metrics, health, and alert endpoints
**Timeline**: 0.5 day
**Dependencies**: monitoring, utils

## Risk Assessment

- **Risk**: Integration complexity | **Mitigation**: Use shared libs, incremental testing
- **Risk**: Schema evolution bugs | **Mitigation**: Versioned registry, migration tests
