## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Data Intelligence Dependency**: Service heavily depends on data-intelligence availability
  - **Mitigation**: Implement circuit breakers and fallback mechanisms
- **Model Performance**: ML models may not perform as expected in production
  - **Mitigation**: A/B testing framework and fallback to rule-based predictions

### Medium Risk
- **Port Conflicts**: Current port 3002 conflicts with prediction service
  - **Mitigation**: Update configuration to use port 3003 as documented
- **Performance Requirements**: High-throughput requirements may challenge initial implementation
  - **Mitigation**: Implement performance monitoring from start, optimize iteratively

### Low Risk
- **Library Integration**: Well-established patterns exist in the codebase
  - **Mitigation**: Follow existing patterns from data-intelligence service
- **Authentication**: Existing auth infrastructure is mature
  - **Mitigation**: Leverage @libs/auth patterns already proven

### External Dependencies
- Data Intelligence Service (port 3001)
- Redis for caching
- PostgreSQL for model metadata
- Monitoring infrastructure

## Conservative Enhancement Approach

**Remember for this enterprise-grade project:**
- 460+ TypeScript files - leverage existing patterns extensively
- Dual DI architecture - use established ServiceRegistry + tsyringe patterns
- Sophisticated telemetry - build upon existing monitoring infrastructure
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM when integrating with data-intelligence, LOW when following established patterns

### Implementation Guidelines
- **Start with existing patterns** from data-intelligence service
- **Leverage comprehensive telemetry** already built into the system
- **Enhance proven architectures** rather than creating new complexity
- **Validate integration points** with data-intelligence service early
- **Implement monitoring first** to catch issues during development

**This action plan provides a structured approach to transforming the AI Engine Service stub into a production-ready, enterprise-grade service that properly integrates with the data-intelligence infrastructure while following established architectural patterns.**
