# Task: Create AuthV3 Library - Next-Generation Authentication System

**Date**: 2025-08-29  
**Task**: Create AuthV3 Library  
**Objective**: Design and implement a next-generation authentication library (AuthV3) that addresses critical issues in existing auth and authV2 libraries while providing production-ready, enterprise-grade authentication services

## üéØ Action Plan

### Phase 1: Architecture Design & Analysis ‚è≥ (4 hours)

- [ ] Analyze existing auth and authV2 library issues and gaps
- [ ] Define AuthV3 architectural principles and design patterns
- [ ] Create comprehensive interface design for all authentication services
- [ ] Design clean dependency injection integration (ServiceRegistry + tsyringe)
- [ ] Define security-first design patterns and threat model

### Phase 2: Core Authentication Infrastructure ‚è≥ (8 hours)

- [ ] Implement core authentication service with JWT handling
- [ ] Create secure credential validation with argon2 hashing
- [ ] Implement session management with Redis integration
- [ ] Design and implement rate limiting with distributed support
- [ ] Create comprehensive error handling and logging system

### Phase 3: Advanced Security Features ‚è≥ (6 hours)

- [ ] Implement multi-factor authentication (TOTP/SMS)
- [ ] Create API key management system with rotation
- [ ] Design and implement audit logging service
- [ ] Implement device fingerprinting and risk assessment
- [ ] Create token blacklist management with Redis persistence

### Phase 4: Enterprise Features & Integration ‚è≥ (4 hours)

- [ ] Integrate with existing RBAC system (libs/rbac)
- [ ] Implement distributed caching strategy with fallbacks
- [ ] Create comprehensive metrics and monitoring integration
- [ ] Design middleware integration patterns for Elysia
- [ ] Implement health checks and service diagnostics

### Phase 5: Testing & Documentation ‚è≥ (3 hours)

- [ ] Create comprehensive unit test suite
- [ ] Implement integration tests with database and Redis
- [ ] Create performance benchmarks and load testing
- [ ] Write comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Create migration guide from authV2 to authV3

## üìä Progress Tracking

**Started**: 2025-08-29  
**Status**: Planning  
**Next Milestone**: Complete architectural design and interface definition  
**Completion Target**: 2025-08-30 (25 hours estimated)

## üö´ Blockers & Risks

### Identified Issues from Existing Libraries:

- **Auth V1**: Legacy code with security vulnerabilities
- **Auth V2**: Over-engineered, coupling issues, incomplete implementations
- **Critical Issues**: Custom JWT implementation, in-memory audit storage, missing distributed features

### Risk Mitigation Strategies:

- Use battle-tested libraries (jose for JWT, argon2 for hashing)
- Implement proper distributed caching and persistence
- Design for loose coupling with clean interfaces
- Follow security best practices and enterprise patterns
- Comprehensive testing and validation

## üìù Notes & Decisions

### Key Architectural Decisions:

- **Security-First**: Use proven cryptographic libraries
- **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation of concerns with contracts
- **Enterprise-Ready**: Distributed features from day one
- **Performance**: Multi-tier caching and optimized queries
- **Observability**: Comprehensive metrics and structured logging
- **Maintainability**: Modular design with clear interfaces

### Integration Requirements:

- Must integrate with existing ServiceRegistry DI system
- Should leverage existing database and Redis infrastructure
- Must support existing RBAC patterns
- Should provide seamless migration path from authV2
