### Phase 2B: Complete Auth Library Implementation (6h) - üîÑ In Progress

**Status:** Active  
**Progress:** 0%  
**Time Spent:** 0h  
**Remaining:** 6h

#### üéØ Critical Issues Identified:

**JWT Service Gaps:**

- [ ] Replace simple base64 `hashToken()` with proper cryptographic hashing
- [ ] Implement proper database integration for `refreshAccessToken()`
- [ ] Remove all TODO comments and stub implementations
- [ ] Replace `any` types with proper interfaces

**Context Factory Gaps:**

- [ ] Implement complete API key authentication system
- [ ] Create concrete SessionManager implementation
- [ ] Implement UserService with database integration
- [ ] Implement PermissionService with role/permission management
- [ ] Remove all "NOT_IMPLEMENTED" placeholders

**Unified Context Gaps:**

- [ ] Implement working `refreshSession()` and `invalidateSession()` methods
- [ ] Replace EventEmitter with properly typed event system
- [ ] Implement complete session management integration

**Guards System Gaps:**

- [ ] Extend Guards to support WebSocket protocols
- [ ] Integrate Guards with UnifiedAuthContext system
- [ ] Remove HTTP-only limitations

**General Quality Issues:**

- [ ] Eliminate all `any` types throughout the library
- [ ] Replace all stub implementations with working code
- [ ] Implement proper error handling without shortcuts
- [ ] Add comprehensive input validation
- [ ] Implement proper logging and metrics integration

#### üîÑ Current Focus:

**CRITICAL:** Complete auth library implementation without shortcuts, stubs, or `any` types. This is the foundational pillar that must be rock-solid before proceeding.

## Key Achievements

### 2025-01-19 - Initial Setup

- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive Memory Bank task structure
- ‚úÖ Documented 5-phase optimization plan with detailed breakdown
- ‚úÖ Created 130+ item checklist with acceptance criteria
- ‚úÖ Established context documentation with current pain points
- ‚úÖ Set up progress tracking system

## Blockers & Risks

### Current Blockers

- None identified

### Potential Risks

- **Integration Risk:** Maintaining backward compatibility while implementing unified authentication
- **Performance Risk:** Meeting sub-50ms authentication latency requirements
- **Complexity Risk:** Coordinating session management across Redis and PostgreSQL
- **Timeline Risk:** 12.5 hour estimate may be optimistic given complexity

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Next 1-2 hours)

1. **[CURRENT]** Begin libs/auth audit - Review current JWT implementation
2. Start architecture analysis of AuthGuard limitations
3. Document current authentication flow and identify optimization opportunities

### Short Term (Next Session)

1. Complete Phase 1 architecture analysis
2. Begin UnifiedAuthContext interface design
3. Plan SessionManager architecture

### Medium Term (This Week)

1. Implement core auth library optimizations
2. Begin middleware integration enhancements
3. Start session management system implementation

## Quality Gates

### Phase Completion Criteria

- [ ] **Phase 1:** Complete architecture analysis with documented gaps and design
- [ ] **Phase 2:** Unified authentication system with performance optimizations
- [ ] **Phase 3:** Enhanced middleware system with proper composition
- [ ] **Phase 4:** Production-ready session management with Redis/PostgreSQL
- [ ] **Phase 5:** Comprehensive testing with all acceptance criteria met

### Definition of Done

- All checklist items completed with proper validation
- Performance requirements met (< 50ms auth, < 10ms session lookup, < 5ms permission checks)
- Security requirements satisfied (audit trail, token rotation, session protection)
- Monitoring and telemetry fully integrated
- Backward compatibility maintained
- Production deployment ready

## Notes & Lessons Learned

### Technical Notes

- WebSocket context differs significantly from HTTP context, requiring careful abstraction
- Redis clustering configuration will be critical for session management scalability
- Permission caching strategy needs to balance consistency with performance

### Process Notes

- Memory Bank task structure provides excellent organization for complex multi-phase work
- Detailed checklist helps maintain focus and track progress across sessions
- Context documentation essential for maintaining understanding across time
