# Context: Data Intelligence Service Task

This task replaces the legacy Data Platform Service with a new Data Intelligence Service, focusing on feature management, analytics, data quality, and compliance. It will serve both backend services and the dashboard, integrating Redis, ClickHouse, and PostgreSQL, and exposing robust APIs for feature, analytics, export, and compliance workflows.
