# Task: Workspace Interfaces and Implementations Scan

**Date**: 2025-08-09  
**Task**: Complete architectural documentation of pnpm workspace interfaces and implementations  
**Objective**: Create comprehensive documentation of all TypeScript interfaces, classes, and architectural patterns in the microservices ecosystem

## 🎯 Action Plan

### Phase 1: Core Architecture Analysis ⏳

- [ ] Document all shared library interfaces (@libs/\*)
- [ ] Map microservice dependencies and patterns
- [ ] Identify cross-service communication patterns
- [ ] Document WebSocket and real-time features

### Phase 2: Detailed Interface Mapping ⏳

- [ ] Scan authentication interfaces (JWT, guards, roles)
- [ ] Document database client interfaces (Redis, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse)
- [ ] Map monitoring and logging interfaces
- [ ] Analyze messaging and event patterns

### Phase 3: Implementation Analysis ⏳

- [ ] Document Elysia server patterns and configurations
- [ ] Map API Gateway routing and middleware structure
- [ ] Analyze microservice startup and configuration patterns
- [ ] Document utility and helper class implementations

## 📋 Detailed Checklist

### Shared Libraries Analysis

- [ ] @libs/auth - JWT service, guards, password handling
- [ ] @libs/database - Redis, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse clients
- [ ] @libs/monitoring - Logger, metrics, health checks, tracing
- [ ] @libs/elysia-server - Server builder, WebSocket integration
- [ ] @libs/messaging - Kafka, WebSocket manager
- [ ] @libs/utils - Circuit breaker, utilities, error handling
- [ ] @libs/config - Environment configuration
- [ ] @libs/models - Shared data models

### Microservices Analysis

- [ ] apps/api-gateway - Main gateway with WebSocket support
- [ ] apps/ingestion - Event ingestion service
- [ ] apps/prediction - ML prediction service
- [ ] apps/ai-engine - AI/ML processing engine

### Interface Documentation

- [ ] ServerConfig and ElysiaServerBuilder patterns
- [ ] WebSocket interfaces and handlers
- [ ] Authentication interfaces (JWTPayload, AuthContext)
- [ ] Database client interfaces
- [ ] Monitoring interfaces (Metric, HealthCheck)
- [ ] Service registry patterns

## 📊 Progress Tracking

**Started**: 2025-08-09  
**Status**: In Progress  
**Next Milestone**: Complete shared libraries scan  
**Completion Target**: 2025-08-09 End of Day

## 🚫 Blockers & Risks

- Complex interdependencies between microservices may require iterative analysis
- WebSocket integration uses both native Elysia and separate messaging library - need to document both patterns

## 📝 Notes & Decisions

- Elysia framework v1.3.8 with Node.js adapter and native WebSocket support
- pnpm workspace with TypeScript project references
- Sophisticated telemetry and monitoring infrastructure
- Conservative enhancement approach for enterprise-grade stability
