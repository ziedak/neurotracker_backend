# Task: Create Auth Library with Keycloak Integration

**Date**: 2025-09-01  
**Task**: create-auth-lib-keycloak  
**Objective**: Develop a production-ready authentication library (libs/auth) using Keycloak npm package for comprehensive HTTP and WebSocket authentication, permissions, roles, session management, JWT auth, login, registration, and API key authentication. Integrate with existing ElysiaJS server, leverage libs/database for database operations, and follow enterprise-grade patterns.

- [x] Create Keycloak adapter service
- [x] Build session management system
- [x] Develop login/registration handlers
- [x] Implement API key authentication
- [x] Create permission and role services using battle-tested RBAC libraries (e.g., @casl/ability, accesscontrol)

### Phase 3: HTTP & WebSocket Integration ⏳ [3-4 days] ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Create ElysiaJS middleware for HTTP auth
- [x] Implement WebSocket authentication middleware
- [x] Build permission-based route guards using battle-tested authorization libraries
- [x] Develop role-based access control (RBAC) using established npm packages (@casl/ability, accesscontrol)
- [x] Integrate with existing middleware chain

### Phase 3B: Code Review & Architecture Audit ⏳ [2-3 days] 🔄 IN PROGRESS

- [ ] Comprehensive code review of all services
- [ ] Security vulnerability assessment
- [ ] Performance optimization validation
- [ ] Architectural pattern validation
- [ ] TypeScript compliance audit
- [ ] Error handling and logging review
- [ ] Integration point validation
- [ ] Documentation completeness check
- [ ] Production readiness assessment
- [ ] Recommendations and improvements

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation ⏳ [2-3 days] 🔄 IN PROGRESS

- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests
- [ ] Create integration tests with ElysiaJS
- [ ] Test WebSocket authentication flows
- [ ] Validate performance benchmarks
- [ ] Security testing and validation

### Phase 5: Documentation & Deployment ⏳ [1-2 days]

- [ ] Create comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Write integration guides
- [ ] Update workspace configuration
- [ ] Create migration documentation
- [ ] Deploy and validate in development environment

## 📋 Detailed Checklist

### Project Structure & Setup

- [x] Create libs/auth directory structure
- [x] Initialize package.json with Keycloak and dependencies
- [x] Set up TypeScript configuration
- [x] Create source directory structure (services/, types/, middleware/, etc.)
- [x] Configure build and test scripts

### Core Services Implementation

- [x] JWT Service: token generation, validation, refresh
- [x] Keycloak Service: realm management, user operations
- [x] Session Service: Redis-based session storage
