# Task: Optimize Data Intelligence Service

Date: 2025-08-16
Status: Active

## Objective

Enhance reliability, maintainability, performance, and observability of the data-intelligence service for enterprise-grade production use.

## Success Criteria

- [ ] High availability and resilience implemented (multi-replica, load balancing, circuit breakers, health checks)
- [ ] Strict TypeScript typing enforced (all handlers, DI, payloads, service interfaces)
- [ ] Route files modularized and grouped (domain-based, maintainable, testable)
- [ ] Caching layer added for key endpoints (in-memory/distributed, cache invalidation, fallback logic)
- [ ] Advanced observability and tracing integrated (OpenTelemetry, metrics, structured logging, correlation IDs)
- [ ] Graceful degradation and fallback logic in place (fallback responses, cached data, partial results)
- [ ] Performance and security tuned (middleware profiling, RBAC, rate limiting, audit, load testing)
- [ ] Documentation and tests updated (OpenAPI, integration/load tests, change logs)

## Phases

### Phase 1: High Availability & Resilience

**Objective**: Ensure service is robust against failures  
**Timeline**: 2 days  
**Dependencies**: Infrastructure, orchestration

**Details:**

- Deploy multiple service replicas behind a load balancer
- Implement health and readiness probes for orchestration (K8s, Docker)
- Add circuit breaker logic to critical endpoints and database calls
- Set up automated failover and recovery procedures
- Monitor service health and alert on downtime

### Phase 2: Strict Typing & Modularization

**Objective**: Refactor for maintainability and type safety  
**Timeline**: 2 days  
**Dependencies**: Existing codebase

**Details:**

- Refactor all route handlers and DI container methods to use explicit TypeScript types
- Enforce type safety for request/response payloads and service interfaces
- Split routes into domain-focused modules (analytics, features, export, quality, reconciliation, auth, health, status)
- Add type-safe interfaces for middleware and business services

### Phase 3: Caching & Performance

**Objective**: Reduce latency and load on storage  
**Timeline**: 2 days  
**Dependencies**: Redis, business logic

**Details:**

- Add in-memory or distributed caching for frequently accessed endpoints (analytics, features, reports)
- Implement cache invalidation strategies for data freshness
- Profile middleware chains and optimize for minimal latency
- Batch or stream large data exports to avoid memory spikes
- Add async processing for heavy operations

### Phase 4: Observability & Monitoring

**Objective**: Add tracing, metrics, and structured logging  
**Timeline**: 2 days  
**Dependencies**: Telemetry stack

**Details:**

- Integrate distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry) for all endpoints and service calls
- Expose detailed metrics (latency, error rates, throughput) for all endpoints
- Add structured logging with correlation IDs for request tracing
- Set up dashboards for real-time monitoring and alerting

### Phase 5: Graceful Degradation & Security

**Objective**: Ensure system degrades gracefully and is secure  
**Timeline**: 2 days  
**Dependencies**: Middleware, RBAC, fallback logic

**Details:**

- Implement fallback responses or cached data if a dependency is down
- Return partial results or “service unavailable” messages with actionable info
- Review and tighten RBAC policies for all endpoints
- Add rate limiting per user/IP for sensitive endpoints
- Audit all data export and GDPR flows for compliance

### Phase 6: Documentation & Testing

**Objective**: Update docs and add tests for new features  
**Timeline**: 1 day  
**Dependencies**: Existing docs/tests

**Details:**

- Auto-generate OpenAPI docs for all endpoints
- Add integration and load tests for critical business flows
- Document new features, changes, and risk mitigations
- Update change logs and onboarding guides

## Risk Assessment

- **Risk**: Service downtime | **Mitigation**: HA, circuit breakers, caching, failover
- **Risk**: Breaking changes | **Mitigation**: Incremental refactoring, comprehensive tests, canary releases
- **Risk**: Performance regression | **Mitigation**: Profiling, load testing, async/batch processing
