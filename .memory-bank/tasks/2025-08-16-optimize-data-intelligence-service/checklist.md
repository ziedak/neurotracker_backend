# Optimization Checklist

## High Availability & Resilience

- [ ] Deploy multiple replicas and load balancing
- [ ] Implement circuit breakers and fallback logic for critical endpoints
- [ ] Add health/readiness probes for orchestration (K8s/Docker)
- [ ] Make DI container initialization fully async and parallelize non-dependent startups
- [ ] Set up automated failover and recovery procedures
- [ ] Monitor service health and alert on downtime

## Strict Typing & Modularization

- [ ] Refactor all route handlers and DI container methods to use explicit TypeScript types
- [ ] Enforce type safety for request/response payloads and service interfaces
- [ ] Split routes into domain-focused modules (analytics, features, export, quality, reconciliation, auth, health, status)
- [ ] Add type-safe interfaces for middleware and business services

## Caching & Performance

- [ ] Add in-memory or distributed caching for frequently accessed endpoints (analytics, features, reports)
- [ ] Implement cache invalidation strategies for data freshness
- [ ] Profile middleware chains and optimize for minimal latency
- [ ] Batch or stream large data exports to avoid memory spikes
- [ ] Add async processing for heavy operations

## Observability & Monitoring

- [ ] Integrate distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry) for all endpoints and service calls
- [ ] Expose detailed metrics (latency, error rates, throughput) for all endpoints
- [ ] Add structured logging with correlation IDs for request tracing
- [ ] Set up dashboards for real-time monitoring and alerting

## Graceful Degradation & Security

- [ ] Implement fallback responses or cached data if a dependency is down
- [ ] Return partial results or “service unavailable” messages with actionable info
- [ ] Review and tighten RBAC policies for all endpoints
- [ ] Add rate limiting per user/IP for sensitive endpoints
- [ ] Audit all data export and GDPR flows for compliance

## Documentation & Testing

- [ ] Auto-generate OpenAPI docs for all endpoints
- [ ] Add integration and load tests for critical business flows
- [ ] Document new features, changes, and risk mitigations
- [ ] Update change logs and onboarding guides
