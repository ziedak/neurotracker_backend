# Optimization Checklist

## High Availability & Resilience

- [x] Circuit breaker logic for endpoints and DB calls
- [x] HealthChecker and MetricsCollector integrated
- [ ] Deploy multiple replicas and load balancing (external)
- [ ] Implement health/readiness probes for orchestration (K8s/Docker)
- [ ] Automated failover and recovery procedures (external)
- [x] Monitor service health and alert on downtime
- **Phase Completed: [ ]**

## Strict Typing & Modularization

- [x] All route handlers and DI container methods use explicit TypeScript types
- [x] Type safety for request/response payloads and service interfaces
- [x] Routes split into domain-focused modules
- [x] Type-safe interfaces for middleware and business services
- **Phase Completed: [x]**

## Caching & Performance

- [x] LRU and Redis caching for frequently accessed endpoints
- [x] Cache invalidation via TTL and explicit logic
- [x] Middleware chains profiled and optimized
- [x] Batch/stream data exports to avoid memory spikes
- [x] Async processing for heavy operations
- **Phase Completed: [x]**

## Observability & Monitoring

- [x] MetricsCollector and Logger integrated for all endpoints
- [x] Structured logging with meta/context
- [x] RequestTracer utility for tracing
- [ ] Distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry) and dashboards (external)
- **Phase Completed: [ ]**

## Graceful Degradation & Security

- [x] Circuit breaker and cache provide fallback for feature retrieval
- [x] RateLimitMiddleware and AuditMiddleware registered
- [x] SecurityService and AuthMiddleware integrated
- [x] GDPR compliance incomplete
- [x] RBAC and audit present
- [x] Partial result logic for all endpoints (in progress)
- **Phase Completed: [ ]**

## Documentation & Testing

- [ ] Auto-generate OpenAPI docs for all endpoints
- [ ] Add integration and load tests for critical business flows
- [ ] Document new features, changes, and risk mitigations
- [ ] Update change logs and onboarding guides
