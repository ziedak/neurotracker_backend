### Technical Configuration

#### Cache Configuration

- **Permission Check Cache**: 2 minutes TTL, high-frequency access optimization
- **User Permission Cache**: 5 minutes TTL, balanced performance and consistency
- **Role Hierarchy Cache**: 10 minutes TTL, stable hierarchy data
- **Max Cache Size**: 50,000 entries with 80% cleanup threshold

#### RBAC Configuration

- **Role Hierarchy**: Multi-level parent-child relationships with inheritance
- **Permission Format**: `resource:action` with wildcard support (`*:*`, `resource:*`, `*:action`)
- **Context Evaluation**: Time-based and IP-based permission restrictions
- **Security Validation**: Role existence checks and circular dependency prevention

#### Built-in Demo Roles

- **Admin Role**: Full system access (`*:*`, `users:*`, `system:*`, `reports:*`)
- **User Role**: Standard user permissions (`profile:read/update`, `data:read`, `dashboard:read`)
- **Guest Role**: Limited access (`public:read`)

### Error Handling & Validation

#### Input Validation

- Role existence validation before assignment
- User permission cache consistency checks
- Hierarchical relationship integrity verification
- Context parameter safety checks

#### Performance Optimization

- O(1) permission lookups via Map-based caching
- Efficient batch processing with parallel permission checks
- Optimized role inheritance resolution with memoization
- Background cache maintenance preventing memory leaks

### Integration Points

#### Service Layer Integration

- **Export**: Available in `services/index.ts` as PermissionServiceV2
- **DI Container**: Uses AUTH_V2_TOKENS.PERMISSION_SERVICE token
- **Type Safety**: Full IPermissionService contract compliance

#### Cross-Service Dependencies

- **Core Types**: EntityId, Timestamp from types/core
- **Enhanced Types**: IEnhancedRole, IEnhancedPermission, IServiceHealth from types/enhanced
- **Error System**: ValidationError from errors/core
- **Prisma Models**: Role and RolePermission model compliance

## Quality Assurance
