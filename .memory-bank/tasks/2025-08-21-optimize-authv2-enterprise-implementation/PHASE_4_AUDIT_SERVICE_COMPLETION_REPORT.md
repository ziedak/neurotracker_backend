- Multi-dimensional indexing: user, action, outcome, IP, time-based buckets
- Real-time event processing with background batch optimization
```

#### 2. High-Performance Search & Retrieval

```typescript
- getUserEvents() - User-specific audit trail with pagination
- search() - Advanced multi-criteria search with date ranges
- Index-based filtering: O(1) lookup performance for common queries
- Optimized result sorting and pagination for large datasets
```

#### 3. Compliance & Data Management

```typescript

- GDPR/SOX compliance flags and lifecycle management
- Data export capabilities: JSON and CSV formats for regulatory reporting
- Automatic expiration and cleanup with maintenance jobs
```

#### 4. Enterprise Search Index System

```typescript
class AuditSearchIndex:
- User Index: Map<EntityId, Set<eventIds>> - O(1) user event lookup
- Action Index: Map<action, Set<eventIds>> - O(1) action filtering
- Outcome Index: Map<result, Set<eventIds>> - O(1) success/failure filtering
- Time Index: Map<dateKey, Set<eventIds>> - Daily bucket optimization
- IP Index: Map<ipAddress, Set<eventIds>> - Network-based filtering
```

#### 5. Background Processing & Maintenance

```typescript
- Cleanup Job: Expired event removal based on retention policies (hourly)
- Batch Processing: Optimized bulk operations with configurable flush intervals
- Statistics Collection: Real-time metrics for performance monitoring
- Memory Management: Automatic storage optimization and compression simulation
```

#### 6. Security & Performance Features

```typescript
- Encryption Support: Configurable encryption for sensitive audit data
- Compression: Simulated 30% storage reduction for large audit volumes
- Validation: Comprehensive input validation with detailed error reporting
- Health Monitoring: Real-time service status with degradation detection
```

implements IAuditService {
  log(event: IAuditEvent): Promise<void>
  logAuthEvent(userId, action, result, metadata?): Promise<void>
  getUserEvents(userId, limit?, offset?): Promise<ReadonlyArray<IAuditEvent>>
  search(criteria: IAuditSearchCriteria): Promise<ReadonlyArray<IAuditEvent>>
  getHealth(): Promise<IServiceHealth>
}
```
