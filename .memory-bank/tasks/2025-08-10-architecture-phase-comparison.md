**Date:** 2025-08-10
**Source:** Cross-comparison of actual implementation vs. `.docs/Architecture-Overview.md`

## Phase 1: Foundation (Highest Priority)

### Matches (Implemented)

- pnpm workspace monorepo structure
- Elysia v1.3.8 framework with Node.js adapter
- 6 microservices and 8 shared libraries separation
- JWT authentication with jose library and RBAC
- Singleton clients for Redis, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse
- Native WebSocket integration with room/user management
- Built-in logging, metrics, health checks
- Circuit breaker pattern in `@libs/utils`
- Graceful shutdown in ElysiaServerBuilder
- Shared server creation pattern in all services
- Consistent TypeScript interfaces and builder patterns

### Gaps (Missing/Partial)

- Kafka Topic Catalog: Topics, partitions, schemas, retention policies not fully documented/implemented
- OpenTelemetry Integration: Tracing skeleton not present in `@libs/elysia-server`
- Idempotency Middleware: Not implemented for ingestion endpoints
- Prometheus/Grafana: Metrics and dashboards not integrated
- Schema Registry: Not deployed/integrated with CI/CD
- Vault Integration: Secrets management not present
- Service Mesh: Istio deployment and mTLS not configured
- Feature Store: Redis + ClickHouse canonical implementation not fully present
- Contract Testing: Pact/consumer-driven tests not in CI
- Load Testing: k6 scripts not present
- SLI/SLO Definition: Error budgets, alerting rules, runbooks missing

### Actionable Next Steps

- [ ] Define and document Kafka topics, partitions, schemas, retention
- [ ] Integrate OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing
- [ ] Implement idempotency-key middleware for ingestion endpoints
- [ ] Add Prometheus metrics and Grafana dashboards
- [ ] Deploy Schema Registry and integrate with CI/CD
- [ ] Integrate HashiCorp Vault for secrets management
- [ ] Deploy Istio service mesh with mTLS between services
- [ ] Implement canonical feature store (Redis + ClickHouse)
- [ ] Add contract testing (Pact) to CI pipeline
- [ ] Create load testing scripts (k6) for all services
- [ ] Define SLI/SLOs, error budgets, alerting rules, runbooks

## Phase 2: Performance & ML (Medium Priority)

### Matches (Implemented)

- ML-powered prediction service and AI engine microservices
- Basic model training and inference patterns
- Redis caching for features and predictions (partial)
- Real-time scoring and feature extraction
- Singleton database clients with connection pooling

### Gaps (Missing/Partial)

- MLflow Registry: Model versioning and deployment pipeline not present
- ONNX Runtime: Not integrated for optimized inference
- Model CI/CD: Automated testing, canary/shadow deployments missing
- RedisAI Cache Layer: Not implemented for ultra-fast inference
- WebSocket Scaling: Redis Streams pub/sub backend not present
- Database Optimization: Read replicas, query optimization not configured
- PASETO Implementation: Stateless auth not present
- Auto-repair DLQ: ML-based failed event recovery not implemented
- Real-time Personalization: Dynamic campaign content not present
- Multi-tenant Isolation: Store-level data isolation not enforced
- Advanced Analytics: Sub-second dashboard updates not implemented

### Actionable Next Steps

- [ ] Integrate MLflow for model registry and deployment
- [ ] Add ONNX Runtime for optimized inference
- [ ] Implement model CI/CD pipeline (testing, canary, shadow)
- [ ] Integrate RedisAI for ultra-fast inference caching
- [ ] Implement Redis Streams for scalable WebSocket backend
- [ ] Configure database read replicas and optimize queries
- [ ] Implement PASETO for stateless authentication
- [ ] Build ML-based auto-repair for DLQ events
- [ ] Enable real-time personalization in intervention service
