# TypeScript Microservices Constitution

**Established**: 2025-09-09  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Scope**: Neurotracker Backend - 460+ File TypeScript Microservices Architecture

## Preamble

This constitution establishes immutable architectural principles that govern all development within the neurotracker_backend TypeScript microservices ecosystem. These principles ensure consistency, maintainability, and quality across our sophisticated 460+ file codebase while preventing architectural drift and technical debt accumulation.

## Core Principles

### Article I: Service Registry First

**All services MUST register with the ServiceRegistry dependency injection container**

- Every service implementation SHALL register through ServiceRegistry
- No direct service instantiation outside the DI container
- Service boundaries SHALL be clearly defined with single responsibilities
- Cross-service dependencies MUST be declared and managed through DI
- Service lifecycle management SHALL be handled by the container

### Article II: Infrastructure Verification First

**MUST verify existing infrastructure before creating new patterns or systems**

- CacheService, PoolService, telemetry systems SHALL be leveraged before creating alternatives
- Infrastructure verification SHALL be mandatory before pattern documentation
- All new features MUST demonstrate existing system integration
- Architectural compliance metadata SHALL be maintained in patterns
- Evidence-based pattern creation with actual implementation verification

### Article III: TypeScript Strict Mode Compliance

**Strict type safety SHALL be enforced throughout the codebase**

- TypeScript strict mode SHALL be mandatory for all files
- Usage of `any` type SHALL be prohibited without documented justification
- Readonly configurations SHALL be used where immutability is required
- Interface definitions SHALL be comprehensive and precise
- Type safety SHALL extend to all configuration objects and data models

### Article IV: Microservices Boundary Enforcement

**Service boundaries SHALL be maintained with clear communication patterns**

- Inter-service communication SHALL follow established patterns
- Shared libraries SHALL be used for common functionality
- Service-specific logic SHALL NOT leak across boundaries
- API contracts SHALL be versioned and backwards compatible
- Database access patterns SHALL respect service ownership

### Article V: Performance & Telemetry Integration

**Comprehensive telemetry and performance monitoring SHALL be mandatory**

- All services SHALL integrate with existing telemetry infrastructure
- Performance metrics SHALL be collected for critical operations
- Structured logging SHALL be implemented consistently
- Health checks SHALL be provided for all services
- Monitoring compliance SHALL be verified before deployment

### Article VI: Security & Authentication Standards

**Security SHALL be integrated at the architectural level**

- Keycloak integration SHALL be mandatory for authentication
- JWT payload structures SHALL follow established patterns
- Role-based access control SHALL be implemented consistently
- Security middleware SHALL be applied at appropriate layers
- Threat detection patterns SHALL be integrated where applicable

### Article VII: Testing & Quality Gates

**Test-first development SHALL be enforced with comprehensive coverage**

- Test coverage SHALL maintain minimum 90% threshold
- Integration tests SHALL verify service interactions
- Contract testing SHALL validate API boundaries
- Performance testing SHALL validate non-functional requirements
- Quality gates SHALL prevent regressions

### Article VIII: Documentation & Knowledge Transfer

**Living documentation SHALL be maintained for all architectural decisions**

- Architectural decisions SHALL be documented with rationale
- Pattern libraries SHALL maintain implementation evidence
- Knowledge transfer SHALL be facilitated through comprehensive documentation
- Code documentation SHALL explain complex business logic
- Memory bank patterns SHALL be kept current with implementation

### Article IX: Continuous Improvement & Discovery

**Discovery logging and continuous improvement SHALL be embedded in workflows**

- Lessons learned SHALL be captured systematically
- Architectural discoveries SHALL be documented immediately
- Process improvements SHALL be implemented incrementally
- Pattern evolution SHALL be tracked and validated
- Knowledge preservation SHALL prevent repeated discoveries

## Constitutional Enforcement

### Compliance Validation

All development activities SHALL undergo constitutional compliance validation:

1. **Service Registry Compliance**: Verify DI container usage
2. **Infrastructure Verification**: Confirm existing system leverage
3. **Type Safety Compliance**: Validate strict TypeScript usage
4. **Boundary Compliance**: Verify service separation
5. **Telemetry Compliance**: Confirm monitoring integration
6. **Security Compliance**: Validate authentication integration
7. **Testing Compliance**: Verify coverage and quality gates
8. **Documentation Compliance**: Confirm knowledge capture
9. **Improvement Compliance**: Verify discovery logging

### Amendment Process

Constitutional amendments require:

- Explicit documentation of rationale for change
- Review and approval by architecture team
- Backwards compatibility assessment
- Migration plan for existing implementations
- Evidence of improved outcomes

### Violation Handling

Constitutional violations SHALL be handled as follows:

- **High Severity**: Block development progress, require architectural review
- **Medium Severity**: Document justification in complexity tracking
- **Low Severity**: Log warning and continue with enhanced monitoring

## Implementation Guidance

### For New Features

1. Verify constitutional compliance before specification
2. Document infrastructure verification in implementation plan
3. Create constitutional compliance section in task breakdown
4. Validate compliance at each phase gate
5. Update constitutional knowledge base with learnings

### For Existing Systems

1. Gradual migration to constitutional compliance
2. Priority on high-impact architectural violations
3. Preservation of working systems during enhancement
4. Documentation of current state and target compliance
5. Risk assessment for constitutional changes

## Constitutional Knowledge Base

### Verified Infrastructure Patterns

- **ServiceRegistry DI**: Dual DI system with sophisticated service management
- **CacheService**: Enterprise-grade with LRU, TTL, cleanup mechanisms
- **PoolService**: Connection pooling with health monitoring
- **Telemetry**: Comprehensive monitoring, logging, metrics collection
- **Database Clients**: Redis, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse with resilience patterns

### Established Service Patterns

- **API Gateway**: WebSocket, Swagger, Authentication (port 3000)
- **Ingestion Service**: High-throughput event processing (port 3001)
- **Prediction Service**: ML analytics and models (port 3002)
- **AI Engine**: Cart recovery algorithms (port 3003)

### Quality Standards

- **Test Coverage**: 90% minimum threshold
- **ESLint Compliance**: Zero violations mandatory
- **Performance Validation**: Required for all changes
- **Security Review**: Required for authentication/authorization changes
- **Backward Compatibility**: Mandatory for all public APIs

## Living Constitution

This constitution is a living document that evolves with our architecture while maintaining core principles. All changes must preserve the foundational commitment to quality, consistency, and architectural discipline that enables our sophisticated TypeScript microservices ecosystem to scale and evolve sustainably.
