- [ ] Security implications assessed
- [ ] Performance requirements defined
- [ ] Testing strategy outlined

### Design Phase

- [ ] Service registration patterns defined
- [ ] Infrastructure integration documented
- [ ] Type safety design completed
- [ ] Service boundaries maintained
- [ ] Telemetry integration planned

### Implementation Phase

## Compliance Scoring

### Scoring System

- **Full Compliance**: 90-100% requirements met
- **Substantial Compliance**: 70-89% requirements met
- **Partial Compliance**: 50-69% requirements met
- **Non-Compliance**: Below 50% requirements met

### Action Thresholds

- **Full/Substantial**: Proceed with enhanced monitoring
- **Partial**: Document justification and improvement plan
- **Non-Compliance**: Block progress, require architectural review
