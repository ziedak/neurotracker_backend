Weaknesses / Risks
JWT Verification (Local): Relies on dynamic import of jose at runtime. If jose is missing or not installed, verification fails. Should be a direct dependency.
CryptoKey Conversion: PEM to CryptoKey conversion may fail for non-standard keys; error handling could be more explicit.
Redis Client Usage: No connection health checks or retry logic for Redis failures. If Redis is down, cache operations will fail silently or throw.
Cache Key Management: Uses simple string keys; risk of key collision if not properly namespaced in multi-tenant scenarios.
No Rate Limiting: Service does not implement rate limiting or circuit breaker for Keycloak/Redis calls.
No Metrics/Tracing: Lacks integration with metrics/tracing for observability in production.
No Unit Tests: No evidence of integrated unit or integration tests for critical paths (token verification, cache ops).
No Graceful Degradation: If Redis is unavailable, service does not fallback to in-memory or stateless mode.
Opportunities for Improvement
Dependency Management: Move jose to direct dependency and validate at startup.
Redis Robustness: Add health checks, retry logic, and fallback strategies for Redis.
Security: Enforce allowed JWT algorithms, validate all critical claims, and reject tokens with weak/unknown algorithms.
Observability: Integrate metrics, tracing, and rate limiting for production monitoring.
Testing: Add unit/integration tests for all public methods and error scenarios.
Documentation: Expand doc comments, especially for error cases and cache strategies.
Graceful Fallback: Optionally fallback to stateless verification if Redis is unavailable.
