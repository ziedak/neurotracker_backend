# Keycloak Auth Library Audit Report

## Audit Scope

- Full implementation review of `libs/keycloak-auth`.
- Focus: Security, zero downtime, zero latency, strict implementation (not just interfaces).
- Context: Used for authentication across RESTful APIs, WebSocket (trackerjs), and inter-microservice communication. Keycloak + custom RBAC.

## Prioritized Audit Criteria

1. **Security**
   - Token validation (JWT, refresh tokens)
   - RBAC enforcement
   - Keycloak integration
   - Vulnerability checks: replay, escalation, leakage
   - Error handling and edge cases
2. **Zero Downtime**
   - Statelessness
   - Hot-reload and graceful recovery
   - No single point of failure
3. **Zero Latency**
   - Non-blocking, async flows
   - Efficient cryptography
   - Minimal overhead
4. **Implementation Quality**
   - Code clarity, maintainability
   - Edge case coverage
   - Concurrency and integration

## Audit Findings

### 1. Security

- **Token Handling:**
  - [ ] Are all tokens validated for signature, expiry, and audience?
  - [ ] Is refresh token logic robust against replay and abuse?
  - [ ] Are tokens invalidated on logout or RBAC changes?
- **RBAC Enforcement:**
  - [ ] Is RBAC checked at every API and WebSocket entry point?
  - [ ] Are permission checks centralized and consistent?
- **Keycloak Integration:**
  - [ ] Is Keycloak used for both authentication and role mapping?
  - [ ] Are custom claims handled securely?
- **Vulnerabilities:**
  - [ ] No hardcoded secrets or keys
  - [ ] Proper error messages (no info leaks)
  - [ ] Rate limiting on auth endpoints

### 2. Zero Downtime

- [ ] Is the library stateless and horizontally scalable?
- [ ] Are errors handled gracefully (no crash on bad tokens)?
- [ ] Can the service reload configs without downtime?

### 3. Zero Latency

- [ ] Are all crypto and network calls async/non-blocking?
- [ ] Is token verification optimized (no redundant checks)?
- [ ] Is RBAC lookup fast and cached where safe?

### 4. Implementation Quality

### 5. Latency & Performance

- Synchronous crypto operations (hashing, Buffer) are present but generally fast; in high-throughput scenarios, async alternatives could further reduce latency.
- All network calls (fetch, introspection, JWKS) are async, which is optimal.
- Caching is used for token validation, introspection, and RBAC decisions, minimizing redundant checks and improving performance.
- RBAC role expansion and permission calculation are performed in-memory and cached, but could be slow if role hierarchies are very large or deeply nested. Circular dependency detection is present.
- WebSocket token refresh and monitoring use timers and async logic, which is optimal for long-lived connections.

### 6. Hidden Bugs, Edge Cases & Concurrency Risks

- Token refresh logic uses retry and exponential backoff, but if refresh token is expired, session is removed. If network is flaky, could prematurely remove valid sessions. Consider adding a grace period or more robust error classification.
- RBAC role expansion uses recursion with circular dependency detection, but very large or deeply nested hierarchies could cause stack overflow. Consider iterative expansion for safety.
- JWT payload decoding uses Buffer and base64, but does not validate padding or catch all malformed payloads. Could improve error handling for malformed tokens.
- WebSocket token validator has placeholder methods for API key and session validation. If these are not implemented, could allow bypass or denial of service.
- Cache invalidation uses patterns, but if cache backend is slow or unavailable, could cause stale decisions. Add fallback or error reporting.
- All error handling logs errors, but some custom error classes (e.g., AuthenticationError) may not propagate details to clients. Review error propagation for clarity and security.

## Recommendations

### Additional Recommendations

- Use a battle-tested npm package (e.g., 'crypto-js', 'bcrypt', or 'node-forge') for async crypto operations if profiling shows bottlenecks.
- Implement robust error classification and grace periods in token refresh logic to avoid premature session removal.
- Add a max depth limit to RBAC role expansion to prevent stack overflow in deeply nested hierarchies; refactor to iterative logic for scalability in future updates.
- Strengthen JWT payload decoding and error handling for malformed tokens.
- Fully implement API key and session validation logic in WebSocket token validator.
- Add fallback/error reporting for cache invalidation failures.
- Review error propagation to ensure clients receive actionable, non-leaking error details.

## Next Steps

- Address all [ ] items above with code changes or clarifications.
- Re-audit after fixes.
- Integrate with CI for ongoing security and quality checks.
