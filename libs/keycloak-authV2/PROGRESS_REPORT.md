# Keycloak Integration Tests - Progress Report

**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Session Summary:** Fixed major authentication issues, 3/7 tests passing

## ‚úÖ Issues Resolved

### 1. Invalid OAuth Scopes (CRITICAL FIX)

**Problem:** ClientCredentialsTokenProvider was requesting Keycloak admin role names as OAuth scopes

- Scopes requested: `["manage-users", "manage-realm", "view-users", etc.]`
- Keycloak rejected with: `"error": "invalid_scope"`

**Solution:**

- Changed DEFAULT_ADMIN_SCOPES from admin role names to standard OAuth scopes:
  ```typescript
  export const DEFAULT_ADMIN_SCOPES = ["openid", "profile", "email"];
  ```
- Added documentation explaining that admin permissions come from service account roles, not OAuth scopes

**File Modified:** `src/services/user/ClientCredentialsTokenProvider.ts`

### 2. Service Account Permissions

**Problem:** Service account (test-client) didn't have Keycloak Admin API access

- Token didn't include `realm-management` client roles
- Admin API calls returned 403 Forbidden

**Solution:**

- Created script to assign realm-management roles to service account:
  - manage-users
  - view-users
  - query-users
  - manage-realm
  - view-realm
  - manage-clients
  - query-groups
- Verified token now includes these roles in `resource_access.realm-management.roles`

**File Created:** `scripts/assign-service-account-roles.sh`

### 3. Test Execution Speed

**Before:** 36+ seconds
**After:** 16 seconds
**Improvement:** 55% faster (authentication no longer retrying with invalid scopes)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Issues

### Test Status: 3 Passing / 4 Failing

**Passing Tests:**

- ‚úÖ should reject authentication with wrong password
- ‚úÖ should reject authentication for non-existent user
- ‚úÖ should reject invalid session ID

**Failing Tests:**

- ‚ùå should register and authenticate user with password
- ‚ùå should validate active session
- ‚ùå should refresh session tokens
- ‚ùå should logout user and invalidate session

### Current Error

All 4 failing tests show:

```
search_users failed
get_user_by_username failed
User registration failed
Validation failed: [object Object]
```

**Analysis:**

- User registration flow calls `validateUserUniqueness()`
- This checks if username exists in Keycloak via `getUserByUsername()`
- `getUserByUsername()` calls `searchUsers()` which is failing
- Error message `[object Object]` suggests error serialization issue

**Next Steps:**

1. Improve error logging to see actual Keycloak API response
2. Debug why search_users API call fails despite service account having roles
3. Check if token is being properly attached to Admin API requests
4. Verify KeycloakAdminClient is using correct authentication

## üîß Files Modified

1. **src/services/user/ClientCredentialsTokenProvider.ts**

   - Changed DEFAULT_ADMIN_SCOPES from role names to OAuth scopes
   - Added comprehensive documentation

2. **scripts/setup-keycloak-test.sh**

   - Attempted to add service account role assignment (didn't work correctly)

3. **scripts/assign-service-account-roles.sh** (NEW)

   - Working script to assign realm-management roles
   - Includes verification step

4. **src/client/KeycloakClient.ts**
   - Added detailed logging for client credentials authentication
   - Helps debug token acquisition issues

## üìä Performance Metrics

| Metric        | Before    | After | Change |
| ------------- | --------- | ----- | ------ |
| Test Duration | 36s       | 16s   | -55%   |
| Tests Passing | 3/7       | 3/7   | 0%     |
| Auth Retries  | 3/request | 0     | -100%  |
| Scope Errors  | 100%      | 0%    | -100%  |

## üéØ Root Cause

The fundamental issue was **architectural misunderstanding** of Keycloak's security model:

**Incorrect Approach:**

- Treating Keycloak admin role names as OAuth scopes
- Requesting them in token endpoint

**Correct Approach:**

- OAuth scopes are for standard claims (openid, profile, email)
- Admin permissions are assigned as client roles to service account
- Roles automatically included in JWT when service account authenticates
- No need to "request" admin permissions as scopes

## üîÑ Next Investigation

Need to understand why Admin API calls still fail after:

1. ‚úÖ Token has correct OAuth scopes
2. ‚úÖ Token includes realm-management roles
3. ‚úÖ Direct curl with token works
4. ‚ùå KeycloakUserClient.searchUsers() fails

Hypothesis: Token management or HTTP client configuration issue in KeycloakAdminClient.
