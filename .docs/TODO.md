1. Read Current Context
   Microservice architecture with API Gateway.
   RESTful API for cross-service communication.
   WebSocket for real-time communication.
   Considering RabbitMQ for queue service.
2. Analyze Code & Architecture
   RESTful API for Cross-Service Communication
   Pros: Simple, stateless, widely supported, easy to debug, good for CRUD and synchronous requests.
   Cons: Can be chatty, not ideal for high-throughput or event-driven workflows, synchronous by nature (can block).
   WebSocket for Real-Time Communication
   Pros: Bi-directional, low-latency, ideal for notifications, live updates, and streaming.
   Cons: More complex to scale, requires connection management, not suitable for all use cases.
   RabbitMQ for Asynchronous Messaging
   Pros: Decouples services, enables event-driven architecture, supports retries, dead-letter queues, and complex routing.
   Cons: Adds operational complexity, requires message schema management, eventual consistency.
3. Identify Areas for Improvement
   REST for cross-service is fine for simple, synchronous workflows.
   But for event-driven, high-throughput, or loosely coupled systems, message queues (RabbitMQ) are superior.
   WebSocket is best for real-time, client-facing features.
   Not ideal for backend-to-backend communication unless you need instant updates.
   Hybrid Approach:
   Use REST for simple queries/commands.
   Use RabbitMQ for events, background jobs, and decoupled workflows.
   Use WebSocket for real-time client communication.
   Critical Thinking
   Bias: REST is easy, but can lead to tight coupling and scalability bottlenecks.
   Assumption: You want scalable, resilient, and maintainable microservices.
   Pragmatic: Use the right tool for the jobâ€”REST for sync, RabbitMQ for async, WS for real-time.

   terative Improvement
   Gradually introduce RabbitMQ for cross-service events and background jobs.
   Keep REST for synchronous, request-response flows.
   Use WebSocket only where real-time is required (e.g., notifications, dashboards).
   Summary
   RESTful API: Best for synchronous, CRUD, and simple service-to-service calls.
   RabbitMQ: Best for asynchronous, decoupled, event-driven communication.
   WebSocket: Best for real-time, client-facing features.
   Best Practice:
   Use REST for direct queries/commands, RabbitMQ for events and jobs, and WebSocket for real-time client updates.
   This hybrid approach maximizes scalability, resilience, and maintainability in a microservice architecture.
