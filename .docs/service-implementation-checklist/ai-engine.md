# AI Engine Service Implementation Checklist

## Current Status

- Partially implemented
- MLModel interface, model registry, prediction endpoints, feature computation, and caching present
- Simple rule-based prediction model implemented

## Missing Features

- Real ML model integration and training pipeline
- External data source integration (database, message broker)
- Advanced feature engineering and transformation
- Model management (versioning, loading, unloading)
- Batch prediction optimization and error handling
- Monitoring, metrics, and health checks
- API documentation and versioning

## Action Plan

- [ ] Integrate real ML models and implement training pipeline
- [ ] Add external data source integration
- [ ] Implement advanced feature engineering and transformation
- [ ] Enhance model management (versioning, loading, unloading)
- [ ] Optimize batch prediction and error handling
- [ ] Integrate monitoring, metrics, and health checks
- [ ] Complete API documentation and versioning
