# API Gateway Implementation Checklist

## Current Status

- Partially implemented
- Elysia server setup, WebSocket, routes, service registry, logging, metrics, and basic event handling present

## Missing Features

- Complete business logic for request routing and aggregation
- Advanced event routing and transformation
- Integration with all microservices (ingestion, prediction, ai-engine, intervention, dashboard)
- Production-grade error handling and validation
- Security hardening (rate limiting, input validation, audit logging)
- Service health monitoring and graceful failover
- API documentation and versioning

## Action Plan

- [ ] Implement full request routing and aggregation logic
