High-level critique — what’s good and what worries me

Good:

    Clear separation of concerns (apps vs libs) and good TypeScript discipline.

Real-time-first design and native WebSocket plans — matches product needs.

Thoughtful ML placement (prediction vs ai-engine) and feature-store / RedisAI ideas.

Worries (urgent):

Ambitious performance claims with no capacity plan — “10ms inference @50K RPS”, “1M+ WebSocket connections” — possible, but not free and needs explicit benchmarks, infra design, and backpressure strategies.

Missing concrete messaging/streaming design — you mention Kafka & schema registry conceptually, but topic design, partitioning, consumer groups, idempotency, compacted topics, retention and DLQ policies are not specified.

Security & secrets operations are under-specified — PASETO suggestion is interesting but you haven’t specified rotation, revocation, vault integration, or mTLS implementation for service mesh.

Model lifecycle & CI/CD for ML are light — model registry, canary rollouts, shadow testing, reproducibility, feature lineage need concrete tools and flows.
Concrete optimizations (prioritized — implement these now)

Define messaging contract and topology

    Use Kafka for ingestion/async pipeline. Define:

        Topic per logical stream (e.g., events.raw, events.validated, features.v1, predictions.v1, interventions.commands).

        Partition key: storeId or userId depending on ordering needs.

        Compacted topics for latest state, non-compacted for events.

        DLQ + auto-repair worker (you already outlined DLQ) — add idempotency keys and consumer checkpoints.

        Use Protobuf/Avro with a Schema Registry (Confluent/Apicurio). Enforce compatibility (BACKWARD/FORWARD) on CI.

Feature store & model serving realism

    Implement a single canonical feature store (Redis or Feast backed by Redis/ClickHouse). Do not scatter feature logic. Offer read API and real-time writes from ingestion.

    Model serving: prototype with ONNX runtime + Triton or FastAPI + ONNX for models that need GPU; evaluate RedisAI as cache/fast path but don’t use it as the only serving strategy. Add a model registry (MLflow or Tecton) to version artifacts.

Observability & SLOs

    Mandatory: OpenTelemetry traces + metrics + structured logging with correlation IDs. Centralize in Grafana+Loki+Tempo or Datadog. Define SLIs/SLOs (p95 latency, error budget) and corresponding alerts with runbooks. You mentioned traces and metrics — make them concrete with instrumentation templates.

Security & Ops

    Secrets: integrate HashiCorp Vault or cloud KMS. Rotate keys automatically.

    Service-to-service: mTLS via service mesh (Istio/Linkerd) + SPIFFE identities. If you run in k8s, adopt it early.

Auth: If you implement PASETO, still provide token revocation (short-lived access tokens + refresh token revocation stored in Redis) and CSRF/XSS protections. Don’t assume PASETO avoids all JWT problems.

WebSocket scaling

    Replace single WebSocket hub with stateless gateway + pub/sub backbone (NATS/Kafka/Redis Streams) and use a Redis adapter for socket routing. Ensure sticky sessions only where necessary. Add autoscaling and connection limits per store.

Schema & Contract testing

    Add consumer-driven contract testing (Pact or integ tests) and validate every deployment against contracts. Enforce schema evolution in CI.

Multi-tenant data strategy

    Choose tenant isolation: start with shared schema + store_id + Postgres row-level security for cost efficiency; design an escape hatch for DB-per-tenant if a customer requires it. Explicitly document data ownership, retention, and deletion flows for GDPR.

Operational checklist (what to implement next — no fluff)

Define Kafka topic catalogue + schema registry + partition strategy.

Build a canonical feature store with read API and streaming writes.

Add model registry + CI for models (MLflow + reproducible pipelines).

Integrate OpenTelemetry, Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Tempo; create dashboards and basic alert rules.

Implement Vault for secrets + service mesh mTLS.

Contract tests in CI for events and APIs.

Create load-testing scripts (k6) and define SLOs/SLA acceptance criteria.
Realistic trade-offs & warnings

    RedisAI: great for caching and extremely low latency; not a full replacement for a proper model server — use it as an accelerator.

1M WebSockets: expensive. Use edge workers and a highly optimized pub/sub backbone; consider using managed socket services (e.g., Cloudflare Workers, AWS AppSync/IoT) if scale is a priority.

PASETO vs JWT: PASETO reduces some JWT pitfalls but ecosystem/tools/libraries are less mature — adopt only if you control both ends and need the guarantees.
Quick wins (implement in hours — prioritized)

    Add a Kafka topic catalogue doc (topic name, key, partitions, retention, schema) — low effort, high impact.

Add tracing/metric skeleton (OpenTelemetry init in @libs/elysia-server) and ensure every service returns trace-id header.

Add idempotency-key middleware for ingestion endpoints and producer-side dedup logic.
Sample decision: if you want my direct recommendation

If you want the fastest path to a production, maintainable system: use Kafka + Schema Registry, use Postgres (tx) + ClickHouse (analytics) + Redis (feature store cache), add MLflow + Triton/ONNX for model lifecycle, and adopt Vault + Istio for security. Implement contract tests and SLOs before optimizing for edge-case scale.
