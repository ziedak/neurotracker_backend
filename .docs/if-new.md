Short answer first: I’d build a hybrid, contract-driven, production-first platform that uses Bun + Elysia only for the hot edge (ingest + WS + low-latency reads), and Node/Nest (or Node + Fastify) + dedicated Python services for everything that needs native libs, heavy IO, or ML training/serving. Kafka is the backbone. Strong emphasis on schemas, observability, SLOs, and automated CI that validates Bun and Node. No hero-stack gambles — optimize where it matters, isolate risk elsewhere.

Below is the redesign — compact, actionable, and prioritized so you can start implementing today.
1 — Core principles (non-negotiable)

    Contract-first: Avro/Protobuf for Kafka + OpenAPI for HTTP. All changes in schema registry/CI.

    Isolate risk by capability: stateless low-latency path (Bun/Elysia); stateful, native, heavy compute in Node/Python.

    Observable & testable: OpenTelemetry traces, Prometheus metrics, Loki logs, Tempo traces; contract and compatibility tests in CI.

    SLO-driven engineering: define p95/p99 latency & error budgets before optimizing.

    Idempotency, durability, backpressure: everywhere you write to Kafka/DB.

2 — Top-level architecture (components & flow)

    Edge Layer (Bun + Elysia) — public HTTP ingest, auth, WebSocket gateway, short-cached read API

        Responsibilities: validate, rate-limit, authenticate, enrich minimal metadata, emit to Kafka events.raw.v1 (async), return 202 ASAP.

        Must be pure JS-only deps. No heavy DB writes or native binaries.

    Message Bus (Kafka + Schema Registry) — the durable event backbone

        Topics: events.raw.v1, events.validated.v1, features.v1, predictions.v1, interventions.commands, events.dlq.v1.

        Use KafkaJS in Bun where needed; heavy consumers use Node or Java clients. Enforce Avro/Protobuf compatibility in CI.

    Ingestion & Enrichment (Node workers) — consumer groups that validate, enrich, compute features, write to feature store & analytics

        Run in Node/Nest or lightweight Node workers. Use partitioning by store_id. Idempotency key required.

    Feature Store / Online Store

        Canonical store: Redis Cluster for online features (fast reads; TTLs).

        Analytical store / offline features: ClickHouse for large-scale historical events + materialized feature views.

        Optionally use Feast or a thin wrapper that syncs ClickHouse → Redis.

    Model Serving

        Fast path (low-latency predictions): ONNX models in a dedicated microservice (C++/Python runtime or Triton) exposed via gRPC/HTTP. Use RedisAI as a fast cache for very hot items.

        Batch / retrain: Python containers on Kubernetes for training, MLflow or a model registry for versions. Use canary/blue-green for model rollout.

    Intervention Engine

        Stateless service that consumes predictions.v1 and decides actions (push notifications, email, variant AB), pushes commands into interventions.commands for delivery workers.

    Delivery Workers (Node)

        Handle sending emails, SMS, push; integrate with third-party providers. Use retry/backoff and circuit-breakers.

    Databases & Storage

        Postgres (OLTP, transactional data) with Row-Level Security (multi-tenant via store_id).

        ClickHouse (analytics) for event bucketing & large-scale queries.

        S3-compatible object store for artifacts/logs/backups.

    Infra & Security

        Kubernetes (EKS/GKE/AKS) with Linkerd/Consul for mTLS and service discovery (or keep simple and use AWS ALB + NLB and Vault). Secrets in HashiCorp Vault.

        API gateway for auth/rate-limit (or Elysia handles auth at edge with WAF in front).

    Observability & SRE

        OpenTelemetry → Tempo, Prometheus → Grafana, Loki for logs, Sentry for errors. Alerting with runbooks.

3 — Key technical decisions & why

    Hybrid runtime (Bun edge + Node workers): gives you raw throughput where it counts and full ecosystem compatibility for the rest. Avoids “all-in” risk on Bun native incompatibilities.

    Kafka as backbone: guaranteed ordering per store via partition key store_id; decouples producers/consumers.

    Redis + ClickHouse combo: Redis for online features/TTL, ClickHouse for analytics/feature recompute. This is cost-effective and proven at scale.

    ONNX/Triton model servers: production-grade low-latency inference, easier to manage than ad-hoc Python/Flask solutions. Use Python for training & heavy orchestration.

    Schema Registry & Consumer-driven contracts: prevents downstream failures and enables safe evolution.

4 — Operational patterns (concrete)

    Idempotency: every ingest includes event_id + an idempotency store check (Redis) before emitting to Kafka. Producers should set idempotency headers.

    Backpressure: Edge pushes to Kafka asynchronously; if Kafka is overloaded, signal backpressure via 429 and temporary token-banning based on rate-limits. Implement local queueing with bounded size + metrics.

    DLQ & Auto-repair worker: on consumer failure send event with metadata + error to events.dlq.v1. A separate repair service handles retries and human review.

    Schema governance in CI: PRs that change schemas must run compatibility checks against Schema Registry mock and fail CI on incompatible changes.

    SLOs & chaos: define SLOs (p95 API ingest < 50ms edge, p99 model read < 100ms) and run periodic chaos tests for critical dependencies.

5 — Security & compliance (concrete)

    Auth: short-lived access tokens (PASETO or JWT with rotation); store refresh/blacklist in Redis; rotate keys in Vault.

    Service auth: mTLS + SPIFFE IDs between services.

    Data isolation: Postgres RLS by store_id for logical multi-tenancy. Option: DB-per-tenant for very large clients.

    PII: encrypted at rest (DB + S3) and in transit (TLS 1.3). Redaction rules applied in logs. GDPR-compliant deletion endpoints that push deletion events through the Kafka pipeline.

6 — CI/CD, testing & deploy

    Pipeline:

        lint/test → build → schema/contract check → integration smoke (bun + node) → deploy staging → canary → promote

    Artifacts:

        Docker multi-stage builds: generate Prisma artifacts in Node builder, runtime in Bun image for edge services.

    Infra as code: Terraform + Helm charts. GitOps for cluster config (ArgoCD).

    Canary & model rollout: traffic-split for new model versions; shadow traffic to validate.

7 — Cost / trade-offs

    Bun edge reduces CPU per request and cost at very high RPS, but increases engineering complexity (CI + compatibility tests). Expect higher initial engineering time to validate everything; savings appear only at scale.

    Using managed Kafka (Confluent/MSK) vs self-managed: managed reduces ops burden at a recurring cost. I recommend managed for early scale.

8 — 90-day execution roadmap (practical)

0–14 days (MVP foundation)

    Create topic catalogue + schemas for core events.

    Create compatibility matrix (dependencies for Bun vs Node).

    Build Bun Elysia ingest POC that validates and emits to Kafka (local).

    Add OpenTelemetry init in POC.

15–45 days (core platform)

    Implement Node enrichment consumer, feature store writer (Redis), and ClickHouse sink.

    Add Postgres schema & RLS for tenants.

    Deploy central observability stack (Prometheus/Grafana/Loki/Tempo).

    Implement DLQ + repair worker.

45–90 days (hardening & scale)

    Implement model serving (ONNX/Triton) + prediction API.

    Implement intervention engine + delivery workers.

    Add CI contract checks, canary deploys, load-testing (k6) & SLO dashboards.

    Finalize secrets (Vault) + mTLS.

9 — Immediate deliverables I’ll produce if you want (pick any)

    full Kafka topic catalogue (names, keys, partitions, retention, Avro schemas).

    Bun + Node CI matrix (GitHub Actions + Dockerfiles) that runs Bun and Node tests automatically.

    Bun Elysia ingest POC that validates payloads, emits to KafkaJS, and includes OpenTelemetry scaffolding.

    K8s Helm chart skeleton for edge service + worker + model server.

Topic catalogue

1. events.raw.v1

Purpose: Raw, minimally-validated tracker events emitted by the Edge (Bun/Elysia). Immutable event log for replay and reprocessing.

    Key: store_id (string) — ensures per-store ordering.

    Partitions: choose via sizing rule; default 12 for small clusters; scale to 25+ for 50k RPS.

    Retention: 7 days (604800000 ms).

    Cleanup policy: delete.

    Avro schema (subject: events.raw.v1-value):

{
"type": "record",
"name": "EventRaw",
"namespace": "com.yourorg.cart",
"fields": [
{ "name": "event_id", "type": "string" },
{ "name": "store_id", "type": "string" },
{ "name": "user_id", "type": ["null","string"], "default": null },
{ "name": "type", "type": "string" },
{ "name": "payload", "type": "string" }, // JSON string or encode as nested record if stable
{ "name": "sent_at", "type": { "type": "long", "logicalType": "timestamp-millis" } },
{ "name": "received_at", "type": ["null","long"], "default": null },
{ "name": "idempotency_key", "type": ["null","string"], "default": null }
]
}

    Producers: Bun/Elysia edge service. Validate fast; attach received_at; write async to topic. Return 202 immediately.

    Consumers: enrichment workers (Node), validation, DLQ routing. Idempotency by event_id.

    Rationale: short retention prevents cluster disk blow-up while keeping enough history for replays and debugging.

2. events.validated.v1

Purpose: Events that passed schema validation + lightweight enrichment. Input to feature extraction.

    Key: store_id.

    Partitions: match events.raw.v1 for simple consumer mapping.

    Retention: 30 days (2592000000 ms).

    Cleanup policy: delete.

    Avro schema:

{
"type": "record",

    Consumers: feature extraction, analytics sinkers, ClickHouse loader.

    Rationale: keep enriched raw events longer to support feature recompute.

3. events.dlq.v1

Purpose: Dead-letter queue for events that cannot be validated or processed. Human review + automated repair.

    Key: store_id.

    Partitions: 3–6 (low volume).

{"name":"error_reason","type":"string"},
{"name":"failed_at","type":"long","logicalType":"timestamp-millis"},
{"name":"consumer","type":"string"},
{"name":"attempts","type":"int","default":1}
]
}

    Producers: validators/consumers when irrecoverable errors occur.

    Consumers: repair worker + human ops dashboard.

    Rationale: robust DLQ with metadata for automatic retries and manual triage.

4. events.enriched.v1

Purpose: Fully-enriched event stream (with computed fields, geo, device info, canonicalized product IDs). Feed into feature computation and analytics.

    Key: store_id.

    Partitions: same as raw.

    Retention: 90 days.

    Cleanup: delete.

    Avro schema (condensed):

{"name":"schema_version","type":"string"}
]
}

    Producers: enrichment workers.

    Consumers: feature extractor, ClickHouse sink, auditing.

    Rationale: separation helps reconsumption/feature rebuild.

5. features.stream.v1

Purpose: Stream of feature vectors produced for users/sessions (append-only).

    Key: composite store_id|user_id (string) — use store_id:user_id.

{"name":"source_event_id","type":["null","string"], "default": null},
{"name":"feature_version","type":"string"}
]
}

    Producers: feature extraction workers.

    Consumers: model training, analytics, offline feature store.

    Rationale: keep append stream for training and debugging.

6. features.latest.v1 (COMPACTED)

Purpose: Latest online feature snapshot per user for real-time read (canonical online store feed). Compacted — keep only the most recent value per key.

    Key: store_id:user_id (string).

    Partitions: match other topics or increase for hot keys.

    Cleanup policy: compact (no delete retention; compaction with occasional TTL via tombstone messages).

    Retention: N/A (compacted).

    Avro schema:

{
"type":"record",
"name":"FeatureLatest",
"namespace":"com.yourorg.cart",
"fields":[
{"name":"store_id","type":"string"},
{"name":"user_id","type":["null","string"], "default": null},
{"name":"features","type":{"type":"map","values":"double"}},
{"name":"updated_at","type":"long","logicalType":"timestamp-millis"},
{"name":"ttl_seconds","type":["null","int"], "default": null}
]
}

    Producers: feature materializer (Node worker) writes update for key.

    Consumers: online prediction service reads (or a Redis syncer copies to Redis).

    Rationale: compacted topic is the canonical source for latest per-key state and can be used to rebuild the online store.

7. predictions.v1

Purpose: Stream of model prediction outputs for auditing, analytics, and feeding downstream intervention engine.

    Key: store_id:user_id.

    Partitions: same as feature topics.

    Retention: 7 days (short-lived) OR 30 days if you want longer audit. Default 7 days.

    Cleanup: delete.

    Avro schema:

{
"type":"record",
"name":"Prediction",
"namespace":"com.yourorg.cart",
"fields":[
{"name":"prediction_id","type":"string"},
{"name":"store_id","type":"string"},
{"name":"user_id","type":["null","string"], "default": null},
{"name":"model_id","type":"string"},
{"name":"model_version","type":"string"},

{"name":"score_breakdown","type":{"type":"map","values":"double"} },
{"name":"computed_at","type":"long","logicalType":"timestamp-millis"},
{"name":"features_ref","type":["null","string"], "default": null}
]
}

    Producers: model-serving service (Python/ONNX/Triton) or prediction API (Node).

    Consumers: intervention engine, analytics.

    Rationale: short retention keeps storage low but allows downstream systems to handle actions.

8. predictions.latest.v1 (COMPACTED, optional)

Purpose: Latest prediction per user (for fast lookups) — compaction ensures only latest per key retained.

    Key: store_id:user_id.

    Cleanup policy: compact.

    Use: source-of-truth for quick read caches or to rebuild Redis if it fails.

9. interventions.commands.v1

{"name":"payload","type":"string"},
{"name":"issued_at","type":"long","logicalType":"timestamp-millis"},
{"name":"origin","type":"string"} // e.g., "rule_engine","ai_engine"
]
}

Final Notes on the Catalogue

    All topics:

        Use idempotency keys in payloads to prevent duplication.

        Enforce BACKWARD compatibility for Avro schemas.

        Add topic-level ACLs (only specific services can produce/consume).

        Metrics on lag and throughput are mandatory (Prometheus exporter).

    Partition strategy:

        store_id for events where ordering matters per store.

        command_id / audit_id for uniquely addressing tasks/logs.

        Scale partition counts based on expected throughput + consumer parallelism.
