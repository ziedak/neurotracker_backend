## Objectives

- Add detailed metrics for batch size optimization
- Implement queue depth monitoring and alerts
- Create performance dashboards for batch processing
- Optimize flush timing based on performance data

## Current Phase

**Phase 1**: Analysis (0% complete)

- [ ] Analyze current BatchedClickHouseOperations performance
- [ ] Identify key metrics to track
- [ ] Review existing cache performance integration

## Blockers

None currently identified.

## Context

This task focuses on enhancing the existing BatchedClickHouseOperations class with comprehensive performance monitoring. The system already has sophisticated query caching (Phase 3 completion) and needs optimization of the batch processing layer for better throughput and resource utilization.

Key areas of focus:

- Batch size optimization based on data patterns
- Queue management and overflow prevention
- Integration with existing monitoring infrastructure
- Performance correlation with cache hit rates
