# Critical Elysia Server Refactoring Task

## ðŸŽ¯ Core Problem

The `libs/elysia-server` foundation library suffers from **code duplication** and **over-engineering** that affects all microservices. **Existing middleware system is comprehensive and well-implemented** - we need to focus on consolidation and integration rather than recreation.

## ï¿½ Key Issues Identified

- **TimerManager duplication**: Exact duplicate of `@libs/utils/Scheduler`
- **Multiple InputValidators**: 3+ different validation implementations
- **ConnectionManager memory leaks**: Unclosed connections and event listeners
- **AdvancedElysiaServerBuilder**: Over-engineered with excessive abstractions
- **LRU cache coordination**: Multiple uncoordinated cache instances
- **Missing integration**: Existing middleware not connected to external libs

## âœ… What Already Works Well

- **Comprehensive middleware system**: Auth, CORS, Rate limiting, Security, Logging, Error handling, Prometheus
- **WebSocket support**: Full WebSocket middleware chain implemented
- **Type safety**: Strong TypeScript implementation throughout
- **Modular design**: Clean separation of concerns in middleware

## ðŸ”§ Refactoring Strategy

**DO NOT recreate existing middleware** - focus on:

1. **Consolidation**: Remove duplicate utilities
2. **Integration**: Connect existing middleware to external libs
3. **Simplification**: Reduce over-engineered abstractions
4. **Optimization**: Fix performance and memory issues
