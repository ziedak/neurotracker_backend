# Memory Bank v2 Constitution Template

_Generic constitutional framework for software development projects_

## Core Principles

### Article I: Code Quality

**Purpose**: Maintain readable, maintainable, and consistent code

- Code follows established style guidelines
- Variable and function names are clear and descriptive
- Code complexity is kept within reasonable bounds
- Regular code reviews are conducted

### Article II: Testing Standards

**Purpose**: Ensure reliability through comprehensive testing

- Test-driven development approach preferred
- Minimum test coverage thresholds maintained
- Automated testing integrated into development workflow
- Tests are maintainable and provide clear failure messages

### Article III: Error Handling

**Purpose**: Graceful handling of unexpected conditions

- All error conditions are explicitly handled
- Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- Proper logging is implemented for debugging
- No silent failures are allowed

### Article IV: Performance Standards

**Purpose**: Meet performance expectations consistently

- Response time requirements are defined and measured
- Resource usage is monitored and optimized
- Scalability considerations are addressed
- Performance testing is part of the development process

### Article V: Security Practices

**Purpose**: Protect against security vulnerabilities

- Secure coding practices are followed
- Input validation is implemented consistently
- Access controls are properly configured
- Regular security assessments are conducted

### Article VI: Documentation

**Purpose**: Maintain comprehensive and current documentation

- API documentation is complete and accurate
- Code is properly commented
- User guides are available and up-to-date
- Documentation examples are tested and working

### Article VII: Maintainability

**Purpose**: Enable long-term code maintenance and evolution

- Modular design principles are followed
- Dependencies are managed and minimized
- Code coupling is kept low
- Refactoring is performed regularly

### Article VIII: Configuration Management

**Purpose**: Manage application configuration securely and flexibly

- Environment-specific configurations are separated
- No secrets or sensitive data in code
- Configuration is validated on startup
- Changes can be made without code deployments

### Article IX: Deployment Standards

**Purpose**: Ensure reliable and repeatable deployments

- Automated deployment processes are used
- Rollback procedures are tested and available
- Environment parity is maintained
- Monitoring and alerting are configured

## Compliance Patterns

### Minimal Compliance (Small Projects)

Articles I, II, III

- Basic code quality and testing
- Fundamental error handling
- Suitable for prototypes and simple tools

### Standard Compliance (Typical Applications)

Articles I, II, III, IV, V, VI

- Comprehensive development practices
- Performance and security considerations
- Complete documentation
- Suitable for most business applications

### Enterprise Compliance (Mission-Critical Systems)

All Articles I-IX

- Full constitutional compliance
- Suitable for enterprise and production systems
- Maximum reliability and maintainability

### Specialized Patterns

- **Security-Focused**: I, II, III, V, VI, VIII
- **Performance-Critical**: I, II, III, IV, VII
- **Documentation-Heavy**: I, II, III, VI, VII

## Governance

### Constitutional Enforcement

- All development work must specify applicable articles
- Gate validation ensures compliance before progression
- Violations must be documented and justified
- Regular constitutional reviews are conducted

### Amendment Process

- Constitutional changes require team consensus
- All affected templates and documentation must be updated
- Migration plan required for existing projects
- Version tracking of constitutional changes

### Compliance Validation

- Automated checks where possible
- Manual review for subjective criteria
- Documentation of compliance status
- Regular audits and assessments

**Version**: 2.1.0 | **Ratified**: {PROJECT_START_DATE} | **Last Amended**: {LAST_UPDATE_DATE}
